        <p>Going up for sale next month at RR Auction is a rare, fully operational <a href="https://www.rrauction.com/preview_itemdetail.cfm?IN=3027">Apple-1.</a> Notably, the computer has no modifications to the physical board and was restored and evaluated by expert Corey Cohen.</p>
    
        <p>The last working Apple-1 we saw was sold as part of a charity auction back in June. It was rated 7/10 (also by Cohen) as it had some modifications to the board and sold for a bit less than other working Apple-1 machines at $210,000.</p>

        <p>This latest Apple-1 with no modifications has been rated by Cohen at 8.5/10 and is expected to fetch closer to the $300,000-$600,000 range. The highest price paid for an Apple-1 so far was $815,000 back in 2016. There are only an estimated 60-70 working Apple-1 computers today.</p>
    
        <p>This one will be offered as a part of the “Remarkable Rarities” live auction next month in Boston.</p>

        <blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <p><em> Apple-1 computer was restored to its original, operational state in June 2018 by Apple-1 expert Corey Cohen. A comprehensive, technical condition report prepared by Cohen is available to qualified bidders; he evaluates the current condition of the unit as 8.5/10. The most remarkable aspect of this Apple-1 computer is that it is documented to be fully operational: the system was operated without fault for approximately eight hours in a comprehensive test.  Unlike many of the known Apple-1 boards, this unit has not had any modifications to the physical board, and the prototype area is clean and unused.</em></p>
